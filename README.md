### Hi there! I'm Alexis. ðŸ‘‹

## A dreamer, a challenge-taker and loves to code. I am currenly working towards becoming a successful devceloper

I have a passion in creating software that would stand out and create a difference in this world. I also love graphic design in general, I've made several posters and infographics which are here for you to check out.
