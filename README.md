### Hi there! I'm Alexis. ðŸ‘‹

A dreamer, a challenge-taker, and loves to code. I am currently working towards becoming a successful developer.

I am passionate about creating software that would stand out and create a difference in this world. I also love graphic design in general, I've made several posters and infographics which are here for you to check out. On the side, I'm a dancer and a history buff who likes reading stuff about geography.
